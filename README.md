# xstl
This is my personal library which is made by imitating stl. Here are all contents:
1. **allocator.hpp** contains 3 types of allocator.
2. **bitstream.hpp** contains a stream designed for bit stream.
3. **bs_tree.hpp** contains maps/sets which are based on different underlying trees like red black tree, avl tree, splay tree and so on.
4. **bitstring.hpp[not finish]** contains a string designed for bits. It behaves like a variable length std::bitset and has most of the interfaces of std::string.
5. **slist.hpp[removed]** contains 2 types of forward linked list, namely loop forward linked list and non-loop ver.
6. **dlist.hpp[removed]** contains 2 types of bidirectional linked list, namely loop bidirectional linked list and non-loop ver.
7. **compressed_tuple.hpp** contains EMO tuple, which is used to implement SCARY machanism.
8. **compress.hpp[not finish]** contains some compress algorithm supports.
9. **huffman.hpp** contains huffman tree.
10. **utility.hpp** contains some utils like getting args/return values type of a function, getting amounts of template args of a template class.
11. **config.hpp** contains iterators, container base and so on.
